Please don't use this.

It's not even in demo stage. I only upload this for backup purposes.


What I'm trying to do:
----------------------

A tool that lets you visually create a graph-like data structure, then export
it to various formats. For example, create relationships between characters in
a story "A likes B, B kills C, ...", and then export them to "pre-connected"
Python objects, or maybe an SQLite representation; maybe even to a real
graph-database.
